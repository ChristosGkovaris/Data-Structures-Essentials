# Data Structures Essentials
Welcome to the "Data Structures Essentials" repository, a collection of Java implementations for fundamental algorithms and data structures related to graphs and trees. These include graph traversal techniques, shortest path calculations, and balanced tree management.


## Code Overview
**Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores all vertices layer by layer starting from a source vertex. Useful for finding    shortest paths in unweighted graphs.
  
**Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Ideal for exploring connectivity and detecting cycles.

**Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. Uses a priority queue for efficient traversal.

**Red-Black Tree:** A self-balancing binary search tree. Ensures O(log n) complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups.


## How to Use
