# Data Structures Essentials
Welcome to the "Data Structures Essentials" repository, a collection of Java implementations for fundamental algorithms and data structures related to graphs and trees. These include graph traversal techniques, shortest path calculations, and balanced tree management.



## Collaboration
This project was a collaborative effort. Special thanks to [SpanouMaria](https://github.com/SpanouMaria) for their significant contributions to the development and improvement of the algorithms.
